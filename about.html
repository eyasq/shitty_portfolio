            <p class="about_p">
                Born and raised in the UAE, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Birzeit University in 2022. In early 2021 after my father's sudden passing, I opened a store to support my family. The store was more of a business success than investing the same time into the field of Civil Engineering would accomplish. Originally, my plan was to go to into academia in engineering and continue my studies, to eventually settle abroad. The death of my father put a delay on all that.

            <p class="about_p">
                I am a driven indivisual who is always looking for a challenge. Running a store and having to be social with people for long amounts of time just isn't my thing, so I'd like to transfer control over the store to someone else and keep it as a form of passive income for me.
                in late 2024, I began studying Web Development. Initially self study at home, I then signed up for AXSOS Academy after hearing promising testemonies from their alumni.
                I now aim to become a distinguished developer in the field of Web Development.
